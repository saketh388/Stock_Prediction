# Stock_Evaluation-Prediction
Holaa, Glad you made it here which is btw the best choice you have ever done.
The ipynb file consists of all the validation and training for the Stock predidction of any company you name it.
Here i have implemented a mini web scrap ideology where you can convert any financial data from web to dataframe of any company you can think of on the National Stock Exchange,
so after getting the Dataframe we can continue validating and training our model and predict the stock price using various time series models.
